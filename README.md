## Features
- Drawing various 2D and 3D shapes interactively using mouse clicks
- Changing the thickness and color of the shapes
- Delete shapes
- Reading and writing shapes in .txt files (Still in progress)
- Applying transformations on drawn shapes (Translation , Rotation , Shearing , Scaling)
- Editing specific shapes based on user choice (all shapes , specific shape , last shape)

## Project Setup and Execution Instructions

These instructions will guide you through the setup and execution of the project. Please ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before proceeding.

### Prerequisites

1. C++ compiler: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

2. Qt: Download and install Qt from the official Qt website ([Download Qt](https://www.qt.io/download)).

3. VTK: Download and install VTK from the official VTK website ([Download VTK](https://vtk.org/download/)).

### Building the Project

1. Clone the project repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
3. Create a build directory:
4. Navigate to the build directory:
5. Run CMake to generate the build files:
6. Build the project:


### Running the Project

1. After successfully building the project, you can now run the executable. Depending on your platform, the executable may have different names or be located in different directories.

2. From the build directory, run the executable:


3. The project should now launch and present you with the graphical user interface (GUI) for creating, transforming, and visualizing 2D and 3D shapes.


That's it! You should now be able to run the project and explore the capabilities of creating and manipulating 2D and 3D shapes using the provided GUI.

Make sure to replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your project's repository, `<project_directory>` with the actual directory name of your project, and `<executable_name>` with the name of the executable generated by the build process.
## Usage

1. Run the program
2. Draw shapes by selecting the shape type and clicking on the renderer window
3. Change the thickness and color of the shape by selecting the corresponding options in the sidebar
4. Apply transformations to the shape by selecting the transformation type and entering proper parameters required
6. Save the shapes to a .txt file by selecting the save option in the sidebar (In progress)
7. Load shapes from a .txt file by selecting the load option in the sidebar   (In progress)
8. The manual is attached for further details.
